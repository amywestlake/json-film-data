      "description": "<p>Strongly influenced by the poetic westerns of John Ford, Kurosawa’s story of farmers recruiting a motley troupe of samurai to help them fend off bandits in turn had a huge impact on subsequent westerns and action films – from Hollywood remake The Magnificent Seven (1961) onwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The early section’s gathering together of the diversely talented fighters is a trope in action movies to this day, while the restrained use of slow-motion in the frenzied final faceoff has since been abused to far less subtle ends. Kurosawa expertly sustains the suspense over a lengthy duration, instilling the story with an almost Shakespearian grandeur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The director’s regular star Toshiro Mifune (here playing the wild-card seventh samurai) later played the lone, wandering ronin in Kurosawa’s Yojimbo (1961).</p>\r\n",
